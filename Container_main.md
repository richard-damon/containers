The Intrusive Container Collection provides a set of containers that
provide 1:many and many:many mappings from a "Containing" class to a "Node" class.
This library assumes that the classes are "Identity" based (as opposed to
"Value" based). It also provides a bi-directional mapping where the Node know
what container it is in.

See @ref IntrusiveContainers for details of the containers
